# Project-0

This is our first website developed using web technologies. This project is a basic website with fully functional registration features. It serves as an interface for developers, learners, and students interested in computer science subjects. Currently, the website only covers a basic data structure topic called "stack" but we plan to add other data structure topics in future updates.

## Project Overview

This platform serves as a self-paced visualization based learning resource for individuals passionate about acquiring knowledge in diverse computer science concepts. The existing iteration of the website currently features only the Stack Data Structure; however, future updates will introduce a comprehensiveer science topics at no cost. Additionally, this platform possesses the functionality to store user data, enabling users to resume their studies from their last, thereby facilitating progress tracking.

## Features

1. This platform offers a registration feature that helps learners keep track of their progress.

2. This platform provides visual content to help learners grasp the topics more easily.
