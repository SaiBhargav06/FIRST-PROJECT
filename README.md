# Project-0

This is our first website developed using web technologies. This project is a basic website with fully functional registration features. It serves as an interface for developers, learners, and students interested in computer science subjects. Currently, the website only covers a basic data structure topic called "stack" but we plan to add other data structure topics in future updates.

## Project Overview

This platform serves as a self-paced visualization based learning resource for individuals passionate about acquiring knowledge in diverse computer science concepts. The existing iteration of the website currently features only the Stack Data Structure; however, future updates will introduce a comprehensiveer science topics at no cost. Additionally, this platform possesses the functionality to store user data, enabling users to resume their studies from their last, thereby facilitating progress tracking.

## Features

1. This platform offers a registration feature that helps learners keep track of their progress.

2. This platform provides visual content to help learners grasp the topics more easily.

## Technologies Used

1. Used HTML to structure the page and used various concepts like forms to get the user data.

2. Used CSS to style the web page and make it an responsive webpage.

3. Used JavaScript for writing the logic of the data structure and to store the data in the Local Storage.
