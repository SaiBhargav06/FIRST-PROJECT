      <h1>What actually is a stack ?</h1>
      <p>
        A Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in
        which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First
        Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is
        inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is
        inserted first, comes out last.

      <h1>Implementation of the STACK datastructure</h1>
      <p>
        In array implementation, the stack is formed by using the array. All the
        operations regarding the stack are performed using arrays. Lets see how
        each operation can be implemented on the stack using array data
        structure.

      <section class="PUSH">
        <p>
          Adding an element into the top of the stack is referred to as push
          operation. Push operation involves following two steps.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Increment the variable Top so that it can now refere to the next
            memory location.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add element at the position of incremented top. This is referred to
            as adding new element at the top of the stack.
          </li>
        </ol>

      <summary>Deletion of an element form the stack(POP operation)</summary>
      <section class="Pop">
        <p>
          Deletion of an element from the top of the stack is called pop
          operation. The value of the variable top will be incremented by 1
          whenever an item is deleted from the stack. The top most element of
          the stack is stored in an another variable and then the top is
          decremented by 1. the operation returns the deleted value that was
          stored in another variable as the result.
